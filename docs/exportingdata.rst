Exporting data
--------------

Datasets can be exported in a variety of formats with the :py:meth:`~nPYc.objects.Dataset.exportDataset` method. '*UnifiedCSV*' provides a good default output, exporting the :-:`~nPYc.objects.Dataset.sampleMetadata`, :py:attr:`~nPYc.objects.Dataset.featureMetadata`, and :py:attr:`~nPYc.objects.Dataset.intensityData` concatenated as a single coma-separated text file, with samples in rows, and features in columns. Where the number of features in a dataset might result in a file with too many columns to be opened by certain software packages, the '*CSV*' option allows the :py:attr:`~nPYc.objects.Dataset.sampleMetadata`, :py:attr:`~nPYc.objects.Dataset.featureMetadata`, and :py:attr:`~nPYc.objects.Dataset.intensityData` to each be saved to a separate CSV file. The nPYc toolbox currently also supports exporting metadata in ISATAB format.


Exporting Datasets
==================

:py:class:`~nPYc.objects.Dataset` objects can be exported in a variety of formats for import into other analytical pacakages, additionally automated reports generated by the toolbox can be saved as html documents with embedded figures.
