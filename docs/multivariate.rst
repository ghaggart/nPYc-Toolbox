Multivariate Analysis
---------------------

The nPYc-Toolbox provides the capacity to generate a PCA model of the data, and subesquently, to use this to assess data quality, identify potential sample and feature outliers, and determine any potential analytical associations with the main sources of variance in the data.

Basic Multivariate Visualisation
================================

Simple PCA models of a :py:class:`~nPYc.objects.Dataset` can be visualised by the :py:func:`~nPYc.reports.multivariateReport` function. This report will take a pyChemomentrics PCA model of the dataset, and visualise the scores and loadings of the model, optionally highlighting the scores by the supplied sample metadata.

Scores and loadings of the models generated by :py:func:`~nPYc.reports.multivariateQCreport` can be explored interactively with the :py:func:`~nPYc.plotting.plotScoresInteractive` and :py:func:`~nPYc.plotting.plotLoadingsInteractive` functions.
