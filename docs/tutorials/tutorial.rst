Using the nPYc toolbox
----------------------

The nPYc-Toolbox is a general Python 3 implementation of the MRC-NIHR National Phenome Centre toolchain for the import, quality-control, and preprocessing of metabolic profiling datasets.


Getting started
===============

Ensure that the Anaconda with Python 3.5 or above, and the nPYc-Toolbox are installed. The nPYc-Toolbox can be installed by using the Anaconda Prompt and typing ‘pip install nPYc’. This will install the toolbox alongside any required dependency, and make it available as a general python package.

The folder NMR contains all the raw NMR data for this tutorial. The tutorial dataset can also be downloaded from the MetaboLights database (www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights), study ID: MTBLS694.

After installing all the necessary requirements (Anaconda with Python 3.x), follow these instructions to start a Jupyter Notebook session:

On Windows:
Option 1: Graphical User Interface: UI
•	Open the Anaconda explorer software and change the current directory to the directory containing the tutorials code and dataset. Launch a Jupyter Notebook session.
 
Option 2: Command line	
•	Alternatively, open the Anaconda prompt console, navigate to the folder where you want to initialize the notebook.
•	Then type “jupyter notebook” on the console. This will open the Jupyter Notebook session in the browser.

In Linux/Mac:
•	Open a terminal/console and navigate to the folder containing the tutorial code and dataset and type ‘jupyter notebook’ in the console.
